# LifeLike 
Portfolio CMS running on .Net Core 2.1   and Angular. 
- Working perfect with Docker. 
- Working on SQLite and MS SQL (Can be improve to working with postgreSQL and MariaDB)
- Still many to do with Frontend  +  Authorization
- Maybe  Admin Panel as Panel

Finally Changed readme:) 

# Build
If you have more than 1 GB Memory you can use docker-compose build on production machine, but I suggest to use  my image from docker and use own config :) or build your image in cloud

## Run 
-   Net Core 2.1: dotnet run
-   Docker: docker build
